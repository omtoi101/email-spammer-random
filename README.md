# email-spammer-random
a gmail based email spammer
to use this code you need to have a gmail account (the email your sending to can be any address)

this spammer is more efficient because it sends a random strings of characters instead of the same message because most email services group the same email together so this spammer fills up the inbox much more efficiently

## instructions
clone the repository
open the file / unzip the zip
run email spammer.py and imput all the information

### it will require the email password because that is the only way it can connect to your gmail to send messages
if you want to send lots of messages put the same email in all the "send to" options, if you want to spam different people then put different emails in the "send to" options then imput how many emails you want to send and wait for it to finish (the window will close when all the emails have sent) its that simple!
